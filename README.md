# Low-income building model (EnergyPlus)

This is the low-income building model for EnergyPlus simulation and its user guide.

## Model description

- HVAC systems,
- energy storage,
- controls, including a reference implementation of ASHRAE Standard 231P,
- heat transfer among rooms and the outside, either
  - natively in Modelica with a detailed or a reduced order model, or
  - integrated run-time coupling with EnergyPlus, aka, Spawn of EnergyPlus
- multizone airflow, including natural ventilation and contaminant transport,
- single-zone computational fluid dynamics coupled to heat transfer and HVAC systems,
- data-driven load prediction for demand response applications, and
- electrical DC and AC systems with two- or three-phases that can be balanced and unbalanced.
